# bookish-octo-computing-machine
A robust multi-functional calculator implementing the Python math library for advanced arithmetic operations.

# Key Features
* **Advanced Arithmetic:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* **Technical Operations:** Includes exponentiation (**) and square root (sqrt) calculations.

* **Scientific Logic:** Features a recursive-style prompt asking if the user wants to perform additional square root operations.

* **Error Handling:** Built-in logic to prevent ZeroDivisionError, ensuring the program doesn't crash during invalid operations.


# Technical Implementation
* **Library Integration:** Uses the import math module for high-precision square root calculations.

* **Data Type Management:** Implements float() conversion to ensure the calculator can handle both integers and decimal numbers.

* **Control Flow:** Uses a structured if-elif-else architecture to manage multiple operational paths based on user input.
